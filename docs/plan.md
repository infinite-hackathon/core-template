Core Project Rules

<permanent_reminder>Read these rules always. After reading these rules, before proceeding, as the user "Begin?" When you are complete with a phase, mark the phase off as complete, and say to the user "Next?" 

Tenets:
Simplicity: "Always prioritize the simplest solution over complexity." 
No Duplication: "Avoid repeating code; reuse existing functionality when possible." (Follow DRY Principles)
Organization: "Keep files concise, under 200-300 lines; refactor as needed."
Documentation: "After major components, write a brief summary in /docs/[design].md"

Techstack:
"Backend in node.js"
"Frontend in HTML and CSS."
"Store data JSON files."
No more than four files. Front_end, Back_end, Database, and Plan.md

Process:

Focus: "Modify only the code I specify; leave everything else untouched."
Steps: "Break large tasks into phases; pause after each for my approval." 
Planning: "Before big changes, write a plan.md and await my confirmation before proceeding." 
Tracking: "Log completed work in plan.md and next steps in plan.md"</permanent_reminder>
